1v 1 1] ACTIO PRIMA 7 5

tum, ut omnem rationem salutis in pecunia constitueret:
hoc erepto praesidio, ut nullam sibi rem adiumento fore
arbitraretur. IV. etenim quod est ingenium tantum quae
tanta facultas dicendi et copia quae istius vitam tot vitiis
flagitiisque convictam, iam pridem omnium voluntate iudi-
cioque damnatam aliqua ex parte possit defendere? 1 1. cuius 11
ut adolescentiae maculas ignominiasque praeteream, quaes-
tura primus gradus honoris quidnam habet aliud in se nisi

Cn Carbonem· spoliatum a quaestore suo pecunia publica,

The vacancies made were filled up
by a supplementary lot-drawing
(subsortitio).

in pecunia constitueret] ie by
the character of the jurors whom
Verres challenged, it was evident
that his object was to get rid of
those who were inaccessible to
bn'bes.

ut nnllam] for the repetition of
ut cf divin in Caecil ξ 72, Mad-
vig on de fin 111 ἓ 43.

iv. facultas dicendi et copia] an
allusion to Hortensius: cf Brutus
ἓ 303, where he is described as
facultate copiosus.

convictam] Zumpt reads con-
iunctam (the Mss varying be-
tween convictam coniunctam con-
vinctam) on the ground that vita
vitiis canm'cta cannot mean ‘a life
convicted of crimes '‚ but only ‘by
crimes' ; but the ablative is used of
the charges on which a man is
found guilty, 11 in Verrem Ι ξ 26
criminibus quantis tn convinceris,
and so by a slight transition it is
sometimes used of the crime with
which he is charged. Cf Suet
Ner 31. convictam also suits better
with damnatam in the next clause.
If we read coniunctam it must
mean ‘associated, connected with’,
(cf pro Rosc A111er§ 39 qnae vita
maxime dlx-iuncta est a cupiditate
et cum officio coniuncta).

aliqua exparte deffendere] ‘make
any desence worth mentioning’.

Cf pro Cluentio ἓ 67 lzaec enim
ille et aliqua ex parte lzabebat et
maiore ex parte se habere simula-
bat: below ἓ 12 aliqua ex parte
recreari.

11. adolescentiae] cf 11 in Ver-
rem 1 5 32 nihil a me de pueritiae
suae flagitiis audiet nillil ex illa
imptffa adolescentia sua etc.

primns gradus lionoris] to be
qualified tor holding the three
great offices of state called, par
excellence, bonores (Hor od Ι 18
certat tergeminis tollere honoribus)
(curule aedile, praetor, consul),
though the term is also applied
to any other public offices‚ a can-
didate must have previously held
the quaestorship.

quid alind...consulem] Diome-
des Grammaticus quotes this pas-
sage thus quidnam habet aliud in
se nisi Cn Carbonem spoliatum a
quaestore suo pecunia publica, nn-
datum, inquam, et proditum con-
sulem? which is certainly more
forcible, but the existing MSS ap-
parently give no variation from
the text. Zumpt.

Cn Carbonem] This Gnaeus
Carbo consul in Bc 85, 84, δα was
a leader of the Marian party.
Verres deserted him at Ariminum
in BC 83 as he was on the way to
his province of Gaul and went
over to Sulla, carrying the mili-
tary chest‚ of which as quaestor
he had charge, with him. Cf 11
