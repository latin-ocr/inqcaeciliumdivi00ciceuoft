ABSTRACT OF THE SPEECH 65

deeper suspected some grave danger. §20 W'orthy men said
to me, ‘ Where are now the courts of justice when a criminal’s
acquittal is secured by his advocate being elected consul? Is
all the army of evidence, the reputation of the Roman people
to go for nothing, if the consul-designate so wills it ?' I was
deeply moved: the sate of the senatorial courts seemed decided.

§21. I endeavoured to hide my feelings and tried to make
light of it. Again when the presidency of this court for next

year was allotted to M Metellus, Verres was congratulated
afresh. ξ 22. Ι was not pleased at this: but I did not see much
to sear. Ι discovered one fact, that part of the Sicilian plunder
was to be employed to prevent my electiori as aedile. ξ 23. One
of Verres⁷ agents came to me and told me of a meeting at which
he had been present, at which Verres had promised large
sums on condition of my defeat. §24 Ι was hampered and
beset on all sides: distracted by the conflicting necessities of
the elections and the trial, 1 was unable to act sreely with regard
to either. §25 Just then Ι heard that Hortensius summoned
the Sicilians to his house, but they refused to come. However,
in spite of all the efforts of Verres and his son, or rather in
consequence of them, 1 gained my election.

ξ 26. Now I could give my whole mind to the trial. I found
that it was designed to protract it into next year when the
praetor and the two consuls would be friends of Verres. Let me
give ,you a proof of the friendship of Q Metellus for him. §27. Ι
will not be silent on matters of such grave moment. Metellus in
his turn sends for the Sicilians: some of them obey: he tells
them that he is consul, one of his brothers praetor of this court,
another is governor of Sicily: that every precaution has been
taken for the safety of Verres. ξ 28. What is this but to defeat
the ends of justice? To what lengths would you go, Metellus,
in behalf of an innocent man, when for such a wretch you desert
your duty and act so as to give a colour to what he says about
you? §aq For they say that he asserts that your election is
due to him. ‘ So’, he says, ‘we shall have the two consuls and
the praetor to our mind. We shall not have Glabrio to pre-
side: Caesonius too will not sit on the jury next year, as he will
be aedile’. §30. ‘Vv'e shall also get rid of other severe and
incorruptible judges‚ who will have entered upon various offices.
