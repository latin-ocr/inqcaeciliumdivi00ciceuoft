X 31] DIVINATJO 2-3„

societas curn Verre eius modi est, ut ea in accusando attin-
gere non audeas. 10. queritur Sicilia tota C Verrem ab
aratoribus, curn frumentum sibi in cellam imperavisset et
cum esset tritici modius sestertiis duobus, pro frumento in
modios singulos duodenos sestertios exegisse. magnum cri-
men, ingens pecunia, furtum impudens, iniuria non ferenda.
ego hoc uno crimine illum condemnem necesse est : tu, Cae-
cili, quid facies? utrum hoc tantum crimen praetermittes
an obicies ? si obicies, idne alteri crimini dabis, quod eodem
tempore in eadem provincia tu ipse fecisti? audebis ita ac—
cusare alterurn, ut, quo minus tute condemnere, recusare non

are mixed up with Verres. See

{a aratoribus] the state tenants
on the aget· decumanus, who pald
the fixed tithe of their year's crop
as a rent. Halm refers to [Ι in
Verrem 111§ 11 for the fact that
some of these were Roman citi-
zens.

in cellam] ΙΙ in Verrem ΙΙΙ deals
with the corn supplied to Rome
by the Sicilians under various
heads. Hence we leam that there
were (Ι) the decumae or tithes of
crops, paid by the aratores, ἐξ 12
——163. (2) the frumentum emp-
tum, corn bought by the Praetor
sor the use of Rome by the order
of and at a price fixed by the
senate, ἓξ ¹63-187· (3) thefru-
mentum aestimatum or in cellam.
This was to supply the wants of
the praetor and his suite (cohors).
It was paid for by the praetor with
money allowed him by the senate
at a fixed rate per madius. The
provincials were compelled to sell
at the fixed rate; hence, when
their own needs or the difficulties
of transport made the price unre-
munerative, they would petition
to be allowed to pay a sum of
money instead of the corn in kind.
Thus the door was opened to ex-

actions, ἓξ 188—2 2 5. Here Verres
is stated to have found the market-

price of corn 2 sesterlii per modius , ,

(or 3 at most, see 11 in Verrem 111
ἓ 189). Having ordered the owners
to deliver the corn at the most in-
convenient places, so that the fixed
price (4 sest for wheat, ΙΙ in Ver-
rem 111 ξ 188) would not pay
thern, he then agreed to take
money for the corn, but he valued
it at η seslerlt'i the modius. Had
he allowed them the 4 sestertii
voted by the senate, they would
still have had to pay him the
balance of 8 sestertii per modius.
But he exacted the money in full
without deducting the allowance
of 4 sestertii. Thus he cheated
the treasury and ruined the pro-
vincials by one and the same
transaction. See 11 in Verrem ΙΙΙ
ξ 202. His conduct was but an
exaggeration of the vices of earlier
governors.

condemnem] ‘ convict ’ him, =
procure his condemnation.

31. crimini dabis] for the predi-
eative dative with dare see Roby
§ 1 162.

ita...ut] will you venture to be
the prosecutor of another, only to
leave yourself without a plea
against your own condemnation?
