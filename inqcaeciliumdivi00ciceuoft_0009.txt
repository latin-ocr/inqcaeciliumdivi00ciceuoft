TO THE READER.

THE two speeches contained in this book represent
with more or less exactness the whole pleading of
Cicero in the famous irnpeachment of Verres. Each is
unique of its kind, and they pair well together ; while
the five books of the Accusatio, afterwards published
by the orator, are nothing more than a grand literary
exercise, and involve a tedious study of iniquity in
detail. Hence the present editors hope that they need
say no more to justify their choice of subject. Though
the notes on the Divinatio have been written by Mr
Heitland, and those on the Actio Prima in Verrem by
ΜΓ Cowie, the work was essentially done in common.
