M TULLII CICERONIS

INQ

CAECILIUM

ORATIO

QUAE DIVINATIO DICITUR

1. S1 quis vestrum, iudices, aut eorum qui adsunt forte 1
miratur me, qui tot annos in causis iudiciisque publicis ita
sim versatus, ut defenderim multos, laeserim neminem,
subito nunc mutata voluntate ad accusandum descendere,

i. 1. With this exordium Richter
well compares Quintilian xx 1 ἓ 57
nam sine dubm zn ommlms statmz
accz satiombus lzoc agendmm est, ne
ad eas lzssvbenm descendat-se videa-
mur, and IV 1 ἕ 49 where the pas-
sage is loosely quoted as an in-
stance of the figure πρόληψις, which
is ratio occupandi quae videntur
obstare. Cicero goes on to argue
that in accusing Verres he is really
defending the Sicilians. For the
odium attaching to the position of
prosecutor see Bmtus ξ 130, de
orat 11 ξ 226, and for Cicero's
own views on the subject de off
11§§ 49- 50-

eorum qni adsunt] the throng

tot annos] said in the year B C 70.
He began to practise in 81. Halm
refers to Brutus ἓ 3¹9 quum igitur

causis iudiciisque] 1 hold that
Richter is right in taking these
words to be a pair as in ἓξ 25, 73.
They are simply an instance of the
common figure hendiadys. The epi-
thet publicis goes with both words.

ita ...... ut] in the usual limiting
{ense of ‘only' ‘to '. See on
31.

definderim] the perfect tense is
used in speaking of the whole con-
duct as it now appears. See Mad-
vig ξ 38 3.

descendere] so we must read,
though the MSS give descenderim
which some have vainly striven
to explain and keep. &scandere
is strictly the present tense, and
there is the implied second sense
of coming down to a lower level.
See Nagelsbach ἓ 132. ‘That I
should suddenly have changed my
inclination and be coming down
to undertake a prosecution'.
