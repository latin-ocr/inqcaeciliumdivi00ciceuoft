ACTIO PRIMA s 5

quibus omnia comperj, reperiebam: fiscos complures cum
pecunia Siciliensi a quodam senatore ad equitem Romanum
esse translatos: ex his quasi decem fiscos ad senatorem il-

lum relictos esse comitiorum meorum nomine:
omnium tribuum noctu 'ad istum vocatos.

quidam, qui se omnia mea causa debere arbitrabatur, eadem
illa nocte ad me venit: demonstrat qua iste oratione usus
esset: commemorasse istum quam liberaliter eos tractasset
etiam antea, curn ipse praeturam petisset, et proximis con—

omm'a comperi] this phrase, from
Cicero's frequent use of it in the
Catilinarian speeches of his dis-
covery of the conspiracy, after-
wards became a joke against him.
Cf ad Att 1 14§ 5, ad farn v 5,
Acad 11 ξ 63. cum in composition
here denotes cornpleteness and in-
tensifies the force of the simple
verb (cf concido convello) while
myst-rio = simply ‘to find out'
either by chance or by search.

fiscos cnm pecunia] cf Phaedr 11
7 2 mulus ferebat fiscos cum pecu-
nia. fiscos = wicker baskets or
panniers for carrying money: in
the lex Acilia ἓ 67 (Wordsworth
p 186) we find pequnia in fiscis
opszgnetur: sor the later use see
prof Mayor’s note on Iuv 1v 54
res fisci est ubicunque notat.

quasi decem] ‘ ten, more or less'.
Cf Ter Heaut 1 r 93 quasi talenta
od quindecim cergi. The usual
word in this sense is circa.

22. ex hir—relictas] how can
ten of the fisci which were handed
over to the kn÷ght by the senator
be said to be leit in the possession
of the senator? If the MSS read-
ing be kept we must understand
ex lzis as carelessly used to mean
all the fisci originally in the pos-
session of the senator, alarge num-
ber of which (complures) he handed
over to the knight, retaining ten

in his possession. Verres appa-

rently deposited a large amount
of his Sicilian plunder with the
senator: some of this was sent
to the knight to be employed in
influencing the consular and prae-
torian comitia (see next semion),
about ten were retained by the
senator sor the aedilician comitia.
Zumpt. For adzapud cf Plaut
Capt prol 49 ut in servitute lzt‘c ad
snum maneatpatrem.

meorum] the electiori sor the
aedileship, which followed these
sor the consulship and praetorship
(see next section).

divisores omniurn tribuum] the
Scholiast suggests a question whe—
ther these divisores were State offi-
cials, which should doubtless be
answered in the negative. The pas-
sage in Plaut Aul 107, 108 magester
curiae dividere argenti numos dixit
in viros treats of Athenian customs.
mogcurz‘rpirrvapxn's· (Wagner ad ,
loc). divisores tr ‘bribery-agenrs’⁷
cf pro Plane ἓ 48 quo divisore cor-
rupta sit tribus.

23. mea causa debere] all the
MSS apparently read fizcere before
debere: but all the editors since
Manutius omit it, because the
Scholiast notes that it is to be
understood with debere. For mea
causa ⁴ in my interests ’ see on div
in Caecilium ἓ 21 sua causa velle.

praeturam petisset] cf 11 in
Verrem§ 101. , .
