ABSTRACT OF THE SPEECH.

ξ 1. The case of Verres affords an opportunity ofretrieving
the lost character of the chia. People have come to believe
that with our present courts no wealthy criminal has anything
to sear. §2 Now when agitation for judicial reform is rife,
you have in Verres a criminal whose guilt no one doubts,
who relies on his wealth to procure acquittal. 1 have come
sorward in this 6356 1101 to enhance the odium of our order,
but to 355151 111 recovering its reputation, reviving its popu—
larity‚ and doing justice to the provincials. §3 By a strict
and righteous judgment you will retain the prestige to which
you have a right, but if you yield to Verres' bribes, all will see
that there lacked not a criminal nor a prosecutor, but a court.
§4 For myself in spite of all Ι have gone through already
l have never felt so much alarin as at this moment, not 50
11111611 31 1116 popular excitement‚ 35 31 1116 plots which Verres
is devising against all of us. He boasts that he has plenty of
plunder to spare, that money is all-powerful. ξ 5. Fortunately
his impudence is equalled by his folly: his designs are patent
to everyone. WVhen fresh from his province he was first im-
peached by me, he was terrified at the prospect osan imme-
diate trial, §6 so he trumped up a 5113111 prosecution to delay
mine: but I frustrated his design by my despatch in collecting
evidence. ᾗ 7. Now when he sees me prepared to gibbet his
infamy before the eyes of all men and an overwhelming host
of witnesses arrayed against him, §8 he yet has so bad an
opinion of you that he openly avows that his greed of money
is justified by its enabling him to purchase a convenient time
sor his trial. §9 Now if he relied on any honourable means
of defence he would not have recourse to such shifts as to set
up men of straw to hinder his trial and give him time for his
intrigues. ξ 10. All his designs are to me as clear 35 day: he
trusts in money and money alone, sor what else can save him?
