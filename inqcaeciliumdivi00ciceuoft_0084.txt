64 ABSTRACT OF THE SPEECH.

ξ 11. All know his life: the misdeeds of his quaestorship‚
his robberies and outrages in Asia, his betrayal of his praetor
Dolabella, whose partner and accomplice he had been. ξ 12.
His urban praetorship was a one continued perversiori of the
forms of justice. The crown of 311 1115 misdeeds is his govern—
ment of Sicily, which he has ruined beyond recall. § 13. Under
him the Sicilians had not even the common rights of mankind.
satiety or ignorance were the only bounds to his cruelty and
rapacity. His career was marked by malversation and cor-
ruption: the torture and murder of Roman citizens: the 11631-
ment of faithful allies as enemies‚ the neglect of all precautions
for the safety of the province. §14 He stripped the cities
of their public monuments, the temples of their statues, 11135-
161ρ16665 of ancient art. 1 refrain through shame from men-

those whom he ruled: §15 and there is no need to relate
them, for all who have heard his name have heard of them: you

for his acquittal. ξ 16. But his real trust is something quite
different. I will briefly tell you the story. On his return he at
once concluded an arrangement with certain persons to secure
his escape from justice: but the bargain fell through when the
result of the sortition 31111 challenges seemed to baffle all hope
of corrupting the jury. ξ 17. Lists of the bench were in every—
body's hands: your names were such as no suspicion could
attach to: Verres was reduced to despair. But within the last
few days these intrigues have been renewed on a greater 56316.
A slight hint first gave me the clue, and following it up I have
penetrated all the most secret designs of Verres and his friends.
§18. The hint was this. Hortensius as he was being con-
ducted home by his supporters after his election as consul meets
Curio (whom I name with all respect for his worth and his
friendship sor 1116). § 19. Curio catches sight of Verres in the
crowd: he goes up to him and congratulates him: ‘to-day's
election'‚ 116 says, ‘has secured your acquittal'. As this was
uttered in the hearing of many persons, Ι was at 01166 informed
