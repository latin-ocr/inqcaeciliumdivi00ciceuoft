5 2 A PPENDIX B.

apud lios dices qui abs te taciti requirunt cur sibi lioc oneris
imposueris, cur se potissimum delegeris, cur denique se divt-
nare malueris quam eos qui scirent iudicare .? From these
passages we may fairly infer that the name divinatio was ap-
plied to such a trial because it concerned not the past but the
future, decided not a question of facts proven by witnesses‚ but
a matter of opinion led by eloquence and argument. Compare
Quintilian ΙΙΙ 10 ξ 3 (speaking of the genera causarum iudicia-
lium) diversum lzis tertium genus, quod dicitur comparativum
...... rarum est autem ut in foro iudicia propter id solum consti-
tuantur, sicut divinationes. It may not be out of place to
observe that the name of the trial was also applied to the speech
delivered by a claimant. Halm well quotes Suet Caes 55, where
we are told that out of a speech of Caesar Strabo Julius Caesar
ad verbum nonnulla transtulit in divinationem suam.

(1) The MSS here have non modo suspitionem (or suspicio-
nem) verum etiam mentionem. On this Madvig (Adversaria ΙΙ
196) remarks that Pluygers is right in looking for some word in
place of suspitionem sti-onger than mentionem. He proposes
then to read subscriptionem, in the same sense as crimen sub-
scribere, ‘shrinking as it must, Ι do not say from directly ad-
vancing a serious charge against Verres, but from merely touch-
ing upon it'. He adds that the speech pro Cluentio supplies
many instances of this sense, and quotes Asconius in Milon
⁶ repetitus deinde est lege Plautia de vi ea subscriptione qnod
loca superiora occupasset ’‚ ending with the remark ‘ Verres accu-
sabatur de repetundis ea inter alias subscriptione quod ab arato-
ribus frumenti in cellam nomine pecuniam extorsisset ’. I am so
strongly convinced of the necessity of this very slight emenda-
tion (for spelling of suspitio see on Ι in Verrem ξ 17), that 1 have
received it into the text. Perhaps further illustration of the
word in question may not be out of place.

(2) Forcellini says subscriptio in re forensi est adscriptio
nominis sui facta ab eo qui alterum est accusaturus, quae et
inscriptio dicitur. He compares Ulp Dig 48 2 7 sicui crimen
