equestri familia et disciplina, L Cassius ex familia cum
ad ceteras res tum ad iudicandum severissima, Cn Tre—
mellius homo summa religione et diligentia, tres hi homines
veteres tribuni inilitares⁴sunt designati: ex Kal. Ianuariis
non iudicabunt. subsortiemur etiam in M Metelli locum,
quoniam is huic ipsi quaestioni praefuturus est. ita secun-

30 Kal. Ianuariis non habebimus.

habebimus] Zumpt with some
MSS reads habemns: but it seems
better to keep the future, occurring

(B c 138) by which secret ballot
was substituted for open voting in
public trials‚ with the object οἱ

as it does in a series of verbs in
that tense and resting on sufficient
MS authority. (Madvig opuscula.)

30. magdala-alum] what this
office was ‹loes not appear: it was
not the tribuneship, for Sulpicius
is separated srom Manlius and
Cornificius, and the tribunes en-
tered upon their office not on the
5111 but on the 10th os December.
Zumpt.

tunity of paying a complime..t to

sion.
