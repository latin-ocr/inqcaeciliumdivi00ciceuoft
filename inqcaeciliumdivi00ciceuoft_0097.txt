ACTIO PRIMA 77

possessionumque contra omnium instituta addictio et eqn-
donatio. *iam vero omnium vitiorum suorum plurima et

maxima constituit monumenta et indicia in provincia Sicilia, ,ὃ · ’ ‹-

quam iste per triennium ita vexavit ac perdidit, ut. ea resti-
tui in antiquum statum nullo modo possit, vix autem per
multos annos innocentesque praetores aliqua ex parte

recreari aliquando posse videatur.

neque suas leges neque nostra senatus consulta neque com-

contra omnium instituio] con-
trary to the rules and principles of
procedure observed by any of his
predecessors: contained in the
edicta pm‘pelua which the praetors
issued on their entry into office.
Cf 11 in Verrem 1 ξ 116 ios con-
suetudinem oeqm'lfrtem edicta otu-
uium reliquit. The rules which
praetors adopted from their pre-
decessors were called edictam tra-
laticium, ibid ἓ 114. lt appears
(ibid ἓ 119l that Verres even de-
cided in some cases against his own
edictum pmsseluum. To prevent
this abuse a law (lex Cornelia)
was passed BC 67 binding the
praetor-s to administer justice in
accordance with the terms of their
own edicta perpetua. (Asconius'
argument of the speech pro C Cor-
nelio.) The principles of proce-
dure and interpretation contained
in the edicta constituted what was
called ius praetorium and corre-
sponded in effect to our Equity,
correeting, supplementing, and elu-
cidating the common law (ius
civile). See Maine’s Ancient Law
ΡΡ 55—72·

bonorum possessionumque] bona
‘goods‚ chattels’‚ perhaps here:
personal property: possessiones,
lands and houses held not in
ownership (dominium), which could
not be conferred by the praetor,
but by occupancy (usus).

addictio et condonatio] addictio
is the proper legal term sor the

praetor's awai-d: condonatio is
used invidious1y‚ as in 11 in Ver-
rem 1 ἓ 105 dicit (sc Verres) se
fosse ei condonare edicio lau-edita-
tem, to denote corrupt and illegal
assignment.

vexavit ac perdidit] Zumpt on
the authority of Guelf 1 only
reads vastavit vexavit ac perdidit.
Madvig (Opuscnla) rejects Zumpt’s
reading on' two grounds: first,
that vastare denotes the result of
vexare and perchwe, and so if it be
read at all should follow and not
precede thern: secondly, that in
rhetorical climax the copula is
not, in Cicero at any rate, omitted
between the first and second verbs
and inserted between the second
and third, when the verbs are co-
ordinate: apparent exceptions he
considers errors of MSS and cor-
rects accordingly.

ut ea restitui· ...... possit] sor the
present subjunctive aster a past
tense, denoting a continuing effect,
see Madvig ἓξ 355, 383.

aliqua ex parte] ‘to any consi-
derable extent '‚ cf above ἕ 10.

13. suas leges] Sicily had spe-
cial privileges above the rest of
the provinces, as little of it had
been conquered in war: the laws
which prevailed previously to its
becoming a Romm province re-
mained in force till the praetor-
ship of Verres. See 11 in Verrem
