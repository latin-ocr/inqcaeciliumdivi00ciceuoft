INTRODUCTION ix

senate reluctantly allowed Pompeius the honours of a triumph
and permission, although he was under the legal age, and had
never been aedile or praetor, to stand for the consulship (see
note on 1 in Verrem ἓ 45). He was elected with Crassus as his
colleague. They proceeded to carry a bill which restored the
prerogatives of the tribunes, and then went on to attack the
senate’s monopoly of the law-courts. Originally the agitation
had been directed to the complete exclusion of the senators and
the restoration of the sole tenure of the equites. But ap-
parently owing to the accession of Crassus, Catulus (Ι in Verrem
§44)‚ and others of the more moderate optimates, this reform
ultimately took the form of a compromise, the lex Aurelia, which
was passed late in the year 70, enacting that the roll ofjurymen
should consist one-third of senators, and two-thirds of men of
equestrian census, half of whom must have held the office of
tribuni aerarii. The agitation which preceded the passing of
this law was in progress while the trial of Verres was going on
(1 in Verrem ξε), the terms of the proposed bill had however
not yet been published (ΙΙ in Verrem V§ 178 cum primo agere
coepimus lex non erat promulgata). In several passages Cicero
dwells upon the case of Verres as involving the continuance or
loss of the senate's tenure of the courts, according as the jury
gave a righteous or a corrupt verdict. Himself a senator and
by no means friendly to the ultra-democratic party, though con—
vinced of the necessity of reform, he entreats the jury to retrieve
their lost character, and to shew by a striking example that
a senatorial court could condemn a wealthy criminal. The
guilt of Verres was so notorious that a verdict of acquittal
would be intelligible only on one supposition‚ that the jury had
been bribed.

Gaius Verres (his gentile name does not appear) was the son
of C Verres, a senator (ΙΙ in Verr 11 §95). His first appearance
in public life was in the year 83 as quaestor to Gnaeus Carbo,
the Marian leader. Verres went over to Sulla carrying the
military chest with him (ΙΙ in Verr 1 § 34). Sulla rewarded the
renegade with some of the property of proscribed Marians, but
kept him at a distance and refused to employ him in any official
capacity (ibid ξ 38). In the year 80 he went as legatus to
Cn Dolabella the praetor of Cilicia, and afterwards, on the
