 

ABSTRACT OF THE SPEECH. 67

if I find that aught of this kind has been attempted in regard
to the present trial, when Ι can prove that Verres often said
that he would divide the proceeds of his three years' govern-
ment between himself, his advocates, and his judges? §4L
This is what suggested my saying that the provincials would
send to beg the abolition of the court of repetundae, on the
ground that while they might hope to sate the rapacity of a
governor who had only to plunder for himself and his family,
they could not endure the boundless extortion necessary to
procure his acquittal by lavish bribery of his judges. ξ 42. To
what a pass have the administration of the law and the cha-
racter of our order come! Your hatred of Verres ought only
to be intensified by your finding that he thinks you capable of
such baseness as himself.

§43 Now is your opportunity for retrieving the lost name
of your order. The courts ofjustice have long been plunged
in infamy and contempt. It was this that prompted the people
to demand so persistently the restoration of the power of the
tribunes, which really meant the restoration of the law-courtS.

bill that if the Senate had satisfied public opinion in the admi-

public meeting expressed his intention of restoring the tribuni-
cial power, he was greeted with murmurs of approval: but
when he went on to brand the misgovernment of the provinces
and the corruption of the courts as no longer endurable‚ the
people signified their will by applause loud and long. ἓ 46.
Now people are on the watch: they have their eye on every
one of you. They see that since Pompeius' bill passed, one
senator of very slender means has been condemned: they do
not blame this, but they do not find much to praise, for there
was no temptation to act dishonestly. 547. Your interests as
well as those of the accused are at stake in this triali if Verres
be acquitted‚ none but the worst suspicion can settle on you.
§48. Ι will bring forward facts so notorious based on such
irrefragable testimony that no defence will be possible. Ι will
searchingly expose all the secret plots of Verres and his backers.
