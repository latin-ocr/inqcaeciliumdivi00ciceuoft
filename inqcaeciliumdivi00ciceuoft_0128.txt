[XVIII 55

nunc principes nostrae civitatis sunt, ante facturn, ut testibus
utar statim: illud a me novum, iudices, cognoscetis, quod
ita testes constituam, ut crimen totum explicem, ut ubi id
[interrogando] argumentis atque oratione firmavero, tum
testes ad crimen accommodem, ut nihil inter illam usitatam
accusationem atque hanc novam intersit, nisi quod in illa

55. qul nunc principes] accord-
ing to the Scholiast the brothers
Lucius and Marcus Lucullus. Lu-
cius had been consul in BC 74,
and was at this time carrying on
the war against Mithradates with
distinguished success (pro Mur ἓξ
33, 34, de imp Cn Pomp ἓ 10).
Marcus was consul the year aster
his brother, he triumphed in the
year of this trial sor his victories
over the Dardani in Macedonia (in
Pison ξ 44). The case referred to
was their prosecution of P Ser-
vilius, the result of an hereditary
scud (de off Π ξ 50, de prov cons
ξω, Acad11§ Ι, Quintilian xil 7
ἓ 4). Neither of them could be
recltoned an orator (Brutus ξ 222),
a fact which sufficiently accounts
for their dispensing with the cus-
tomary opening speech.

illm! cz me novum] the innova-
tion would consist in first setting
forth a count of the accusation in
sull (nt crimen lotum explicem),
then, aster strengthening it by ar-
gumentative discourse, to proceed
at once to the examination of the
witnesses proper to that particular
charge (tum ἀπίω ad crimen accom-
medem). 'she ordinary course was
for both the prosecutor-'s and ‹le-
sendant's counsel to deliver speech-
es which went over the whole case
first, and then to proceed to the
evidence (lum, cnm omnia dicta
sunt). Cicero by his ‘stratagem'
managed to forestall Hortensius'
speech, which was intended to be

prolonged till the votive games
(above ἐξ 33, 34), by the produc-
tion of the evidence in the course
of his own speech: evidence which
he n'ghtly, as the event proved,
thought would prove overwhelm-
ing. Cf 11 in Verrem 1 ἓ 29
etenim sic me ipfflm egisse memoria
tenetis ut in tesfibus interrogandis
omnia crimina proponerem et ex-
plirarem ut cum rem totam in
medlo posuissem tum deniqne testem
z'ntemagrarenz.

[interrogando] I have brack-
eted this word as being either
a corruption of some word now
lost, or as a gloss inserted by some
‘grammaticus’ without regard to
the sense, to make a more com-
plete correspondence (z'nterrqgramlo
aagnmentis alque oratione) to eadem
interrqgranclifizcullas algnmentan-
tandi dicendique just beIOW. It
is hopeless to extract any mean-
ing from it as it stands : the sense
is : aster establishing and develop-
ing the charge by arguments and
discourse, Cicero would tlzen pro-
ceed to the examination of wit-
nesses (tum testes acl crimen accom-
modem). Cf 11 in Verr 1 ἓ 29 ut
cum rem totam in medio posuissem
tn m deniqne mrem interrogarem.
Madvig (opuscula) proposes to
cject intem-‹gamio altogether from
the text: 1 have only bracketed
it, as the consensus of MSS seems
to me to point to a corruption
rather than an interpolation.
