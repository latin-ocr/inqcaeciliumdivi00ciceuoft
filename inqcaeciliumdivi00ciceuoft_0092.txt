stultitia coniuncta est. nam ut apertus in corripiendis
pecuniis fuit, sic in spe corrumpendi iudicii perspicua sua
consilia conatusque omnibus fecit. semel ait se in vita
pertimuisse, tum cum primurn a me reus factus est, quod
cum e provincia recens esset invidiaque et infamia non
recenti sed vetere ac diuturna flagraret, tum ad iudicium
6 corrumpendum tempus alienum offenderet( 6. itaque cum
ego diem inquirendi in Sicilia perexiguam postulavissem‚
invenit iste qui sibi in Achaia biduo breviorem diem postu-
laret, non ut is idem conficeret diligentia et industria sua,
quod ego meo labore et vigiliis consecutus sum. etenim
ille Achaicus inquisitor ne Brundisium quidem pervenit:
ego Siciliam totam quinquaginta diebus sic obii, ut omnium

corrumpendi iudicis] corrumpere
here as below ἓ 28 has not its
usual meaning of bribery alone5
but denotes any manner of bring-
ing about a failure of justice.
Zumpt gives ‘irritum faeere, elu-
dere as equivalents.

cnm primum a me rens] ie at
the preliminary process before the
praetor (nominis delatio, citatio,
interrogatio) when the prosecutor
stated the charge (aio te Siculos
spoliasse) the defendant denied it,
and then atter the charge had
been formally drawn up and
signed by the prosecutor and his
supporters (subscriptores), the de-
fendant's name (he then properly
became rens) was registered by
the praetor, and a day was fixed
for the trial. Schol. See Ram-
say's Roman Antiquities, art iu-
dicia publica.

5. flagraret] cf ad Att IV 18
ἓ 2 consules flagrant infirmia and
below ξ 43 gravi diuturnoque iam
flagramus infamia.

alienum] for this construction
aster alienum cf Caesar Β G JV
34 ad lacessendum alienum esse
tempus. Alienus also takes the

genitive, dative, ablative and ab·
lative with ab.

o cuderet] the subjunctive ex-
presses that this was what Verres
said.

6. in Sicilia] so the two Guelf
MSS and Lag 29· The common
reading is in Siciliam but in Sici-
liam inquirere can hardly mean ‘ to
make enquiry in¹ Sicily'. In the
next line Zumpt reads in Achaiam
against the authority of his favour-
ite MSS Guelff 1, 2: which have
in Achaia. Zumpt's reading makes
an awkward change of construc-
tion, as in Achaiam must mean
‘to go to Achaia’ or something of
the sort. With in A clzoia we
must understand inquirendi to be
repeited.

diem perexiguam] 110 days (11
in Verrem 1 ἕ 30). Dies as usual
in this sense is feminine.

invenit iste qui ...... postularet]
who this was is unknown, and
the names of the sharn prosecutor
and accused are immaterial. Cf
11 in Verrem Ι ἓ 3ο izztmposuistis
accusatorem etc.

sic] ‘so thoroughly’.
