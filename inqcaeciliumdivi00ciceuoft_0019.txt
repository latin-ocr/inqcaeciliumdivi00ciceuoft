ABSTRACT OF THE DIVINATJO xv

rest upon the appointment of Caecilius. If I am to be pro-
secutor it will be dangerous to attempt any malpractices with
a view to an acquittal. I shall guard the interests not only of
Sicily but also of Rome.

Now what are you fit sor, Caecilius? you are so unfit

to undertake a case like this, that you actually do not know
your own unfitness.

Are you upright and guiltless yourself? The Sicilians
alone have had the chance of forming an opinion, and
they say ‘ No’.

Are you staunch and true? your intimacy with Verres
does not look like it. In fact, how can you lay to the
charge of Verres evil deeds in which you have been an
accomplice? you are bound up with Verres, you have
shared his spoils. Make way then for one who can
with a clear conscience press the charges as they should
be pressed.

Have you the abilities and experience to fit you for such
a case as this? no: whatever my powers may be, there
can be no doubt about yours. They are neither suffi-
ciently strong by nature nor cultivated by practice to
enable you to undertake such a pleading. lt is your
ignorance that gives you confidence: my experience
makes me feel nervouS. Ι much doubt whether the
rnere statement of the case would not be too great an
effort for you. How will it be when you have to meet
Hortensius? he, who would meet me with cantion, will
make light of you3 he will so bewilder and silence you
that you will not remember a word of the lesson you
have learnt, and when called upon to reply you will be
dumb. Your per-sormance to-day will shew whether my
words are true or not. If you urge that you are well
supported, and could undertake the prosecution of Verres
in reliance upon your juniors, 1 reply that they are very
little if at all better than yourself, and that they will not
do their best for fear of eclipsing you.

With all these shortcomings, what claim have you? as

one wronged by Verres, you will say. But this though true
