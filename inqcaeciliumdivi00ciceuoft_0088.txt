68 ABSTRACT OF THE SPEECH.

established, a bench of such dignity and high character 35
this: none 011161· could be found superior in the whole Senate.
ξ 50. So I pray heaven that no one here but Verres may be
found 3 ν1113111; and Ι 61661316 11131 if any such shall be found, Ι
will devote all my energies to procure the punishment of their
crime. §51. But you, Glabrio, can provide that no such unto-
ward event shall ensue. Do you be the champion of integrity
and honour, of the senate and the law-courts„ Remember the
strict and severe law passed by your father. ξ 52. Think of
your father's sturdy and bitter opposition to unprincipled men:
imitate your grandsire Scaevola’s pmdence, your father-in-law
Scaurus’ immovable constancy: and the people will perceive
that Verres’ wealth has only availed to 6111131166 1116 suspicions
of his guilt.

ξ 53. I will not allow this 6356 10 pass into the hands of
a new praetor and a new jury, 1101· suffer the Sicilians to be
611631661 of their rights by 1116 consuls of next year. ξ 54. I will
not allow 3 long interval of delay between my speech 31161 1116
defence, nor suffer the decision to be put off till after the de-
parture of the crowds that now throngthe capital. ξ 55. I intend
to 6311 my witnesses at once: and Ι shall introduce 3 novelty
by examining 1116111 111 1116 course of my speech, on each count
of the indictment; the other side will have 35 much opportunity
sor argument and cross-cxamination 35 Ι. This plan is 116665-
sarily adopted to baffie their intrigucs. ξ 56. My charge in this
first pleading is this: 1 affirm that Gaius verres, besides many
acts of liccnce and cruclty⁷ 1135 contrary to the laws carried
off forty thousand sestertia from Sicily. This 1 will prove by
0131 31161 documentary evidence of every kind. Ι have finished.
