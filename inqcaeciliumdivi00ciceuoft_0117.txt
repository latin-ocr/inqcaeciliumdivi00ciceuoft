ACTIO PRIMA 97

Calidius damnatus dixerit minoris sestertium triginta milibus
praetorium hominem honeste non posse damnari, quid sit
quod P Septimio senatore damnato, Q Hortensio praetore
de pecuniis repetundis lis aestimata sit eo nomine, quod ille
ob rem iudicandam pecuniam accepisset, 39. quod in C 39
Herennio, quod in C Popilio senatoribus, qui ambo pecu-

latus damnati sunt, quod in M Atilio, qui de maiestate? v ··

power by Sulla see on div in Cae-
cilium § 8, on the ius prendendi of
the tribunes see Gellius XIII 12
who quotes Ateius Capito and
Varro to prove that the tribunes
had the ius prendendi but not the
ius vocandi (which belonged only
to those magistrates who had im-
pelium).

Q Calidius] condemned accord-
ing to the Scholiast in Bc 77 in
the quaestio de repetundis (praetor
urbanus 79, praetor of Spain 78).

sertertium tmjgz‘nta milibus] z
³6²4& The Scholiast. read tricies,
sc centena milia=A24,000. If
the latter reading be adopted it
must be understood of the whole
sum paid: if the former, of the
sum paid to each iudex ‘Auo
a-piece’. minoris: on the so-called
genitive of price see Roby 11 pre-
face, who refers it to the locative
‘price at which’ (cf nec pili fizcit
uni Catull XVII 17)-and considers
pluris minoris, the only palpable
genitives used in this sense, to be
derived from a false analogy.

honeste] ‘decently’, ‘with pro-
priety’. Calidius according to the
Scholiast thanked his judges for
their honestas in selling him at
a price not beneath his dignity as
a praetorius homo.

Septimio] on this see the pro
Cluent ἐξ 115 soll 138 foll where
it appears that Septimius was
condemned not for receiving a
bribe in the trial of Oppianicus

DIV

(iudicium lzmz'anmn) but on other
charges (aliis criminibus), cf espe-
cially ἓξ 138, 139 where Cicero
refers to this passage and contends
that it ought not to be brought up
against him, as the statements here
made were grounded only on com-
mon repon, not on personal in-
vestigation of the facts, and avows
that they were made merely to
suit his case, not as expressing his
own deliberate opinion (errat ve-
lzementer si quis in orationibus
nastris quas in iudiciis habuimus
auctoritates nostras consignatas se
luthere arbitratur. Omnes enim
illae causarum ac temporum sunt
non lzominmn ipsorum aut patro-
norum etc). In the pro Cluent his
object was to prove that Oppiani-
cus was righteously condemned,
here of course to magnify the cor-
ruption of the senatorial tribunals.

lis aestimata sit] on the litis aesti-
matiozassessment of damages cf
'Ramsay on pro Cluent ἓ 115.
Septimius after having been found
guilty on a charge de repetundis
was, in addition to the fine inflicted
for that ossence, also sentenced to
a fine on the count (eo nomine)
of having taken a bribe in the
Junian trial.

39. factum est—sunt—est] note
the anacoluthon in the sudden
transition to the indicative as if
the three latter clauses depended
not on cognoscet quid sit but on
quid est simply.
