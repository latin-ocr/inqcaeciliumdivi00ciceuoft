The evidence was so overwhelming that Hortensius practically
‘threw up his brief’ by refusing to cross-examine any os the
witnesses (ΙΙ in Verr V ξ 15 5, Orator ξ 129 nobis prosamilz'arz' reo
summus orator uon respondit Hortensius). Verres retired before
the verdict into voluntary exile at Massilia, and was condemned
to outlawry (aquae et zgrm's interdictio) and a fine of twice (or
two and a half times) the amount of his extortions. Cicero,
unwilling to lose the fruits of his diligence, and with the object
of plunging Verres in still deeper infamy, published the five
books of the second Actio, which were never spoken, cast in the
form of a speech delivered after the comperendinatio or adjourn-
ment which took place in all trials de repetundis. By his corn-
plete success in this trial he suddenly leapt into the position of
the soremost forensic orator of the time: Hortensius hitherto
the acknowledged ⁶ king os the courts'(1 in Verr ξ 35) was forced
to yield to his younger rival and to take the second place (see
Brutus ἕ 319⁴foll). Verres lived at Massilia till the second
triumvirate, when, as Pliny relates (hist nat XXXIV 2), he was
proscribed by Antonius for refusing to give up some vessels of
Corinthian bronze which the latter desired to get possession of.
He met his death with fortitude (Seneca Suasor c 6), and not
until he had had the satisfaction of hearing of the murder of his
old accuser.
