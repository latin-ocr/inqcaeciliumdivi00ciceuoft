manere apud ordinem senatorium volunt, queruntur ac-
cusatores se idoneos non habere 3 qui accusare possunt,
iudiciorum severitatem desiderant: populus Romanus in-
terea, tametsi multis incommodis difficultatibusque adfectus
est, tamen nihil aeque in re publica atque illam veterem

iudiciorum vim gravitatemque requirit.

ἓ 12. Since the lex Cornelia of
Sulla (BC 81) the indicia had been
in the hands of the Senate, as they
had been before the lex Sempronia
of C Gracchus (BC 122). The
lenity shewn in dealing with the
maladministration of provincial go-
vernors brought on an agitation
sor reform in the constitution of
the courts, which had now reached
its height. Cicero dexterously
works upon the jury, seeking to
put them on their good behaviour.
But, notwithstanding the upright-
ness of the jury which tried Verres,
the transfer was brought about in
this very year by the law of the
Praetor L Aurelius Cotta. See
Ramsay's Roman Antiquities c IX
pp 292—3‚ and note on 1 in Ver-
rem § 2. Halm adds 11 in Verrem
v ξ 173.

accusatores idoneos] sor the accu-
sations undertaken at Rome by
young men of high birth but lack-
ing experience, merely to gain
popular-ity, see ἐξ 24, 68, and Meri-
vale's History of the Romans c 44.

iudiciorum severitatem] ‘ strict
administration ofjustice'. So pro
Mur ἓ 10 pro amici periculo: ⁶ sor
a friend in danger’.

severitatem] compare ἓξ 18, 21
and Ι in Verrem ξ 43 nulla in
indiciis severitas, nulla η’ίιζξίσ,
nulla deniqne iam elertimantnr
esse iudicia.

incommodis] from the oligarchic
reaction under Sulla. Compare
§s ‚ 70-

cgfficultatibus] the impoverish-
ment and disabilities consequent
on the above.

veterem vim] whether the eques—
trian juries did not shew favour to
extortionate tax-sarmers (who were
of their own order) may well be
doubted. See note on Ι in Verrem

requirit] ‘feels the want of ² like
desiderant above. So ἐξ 18, 71, pro
Mur§ 61. See 11 inVerrem νς 163.

tribunicia potestas] restored ear—
lier in this year by the consul
Pompeius. See Velleius 11 30 § 4
lzoc consulatu Pompeius tribuni-
ciam potestalem restitnit, cuins
Sulla imaginem †sine mvl· relique-
rat, in Verrem ἓξ 44—45, Appian
BC 11 29. The agitation for this
had been supported by Caesar (see
Suet Caesar 5). Their importance
in judicial matters consisted, as
Halm remarks, in their right of
bringing before the comitia tributa
propositions for the infliction of
fines upon corrupt jurymen and
magistrates who had overstepped
their powers.

ordo alins] equestris. Compare
1 in Verrem ξ 49, Velleius 11 32
ξ 3, the latter of which gives a
singularly inaccurate statement of
the result. For the compromise
which was actually effected see
note on 1 in Verrem ἓ 2.
