aeliane el privato iure repetuntur,- where the use offere implies
that they had the right to prosecute criminally‚ although they
generally proceeded by a civil suit. But that the primary
object of the leges de repetundis was the protection of the
provincials and that the court dealt chiefly with the extortions
of officials in the provinces is clear from many passages (div
in Caecilium ἐξ 17, 13, Ι in Verrem §42‚ 11 in Verrem 1 ξ 15 ete.).

ἡ 1. The quaestio perpetua de repetundis (the first of the
quaestiones papalum) was established by the lex Calpurnia os
L Calpurnius Piso enacted BC 149 (ΙΙ in Verrem ΙΙΙ § 195 eto).
The praetor peregrinus presided and the court was composed of
senators3 the procedure was by the ordinary civil action known
ι as sacramenlo (Wordsworth's early Latin pp 178, 426). The
penalty was the forfeiture of the cantion-money deposited by
the defendant, together with the sum estimated by the jury as
extorted or illegally received. This law was followed by the
lex Julia de repetundis, of the provisions of which nothing is
known. ln passing we may observe that the lex Cassia tabel-
laria (BC 138) substituted secret ballot for the open voting
which had hitherto been the rule in criminal trials (iudicia
publica), de legibus 111 ξ 35, pro Sest ξ 103.

2. In B C 123 or 122 was passed the lex Acilia, the author
of which was M’ Acilius Glabrio, the father of the Glabrio who
presided in the trial os Verres (1 in Verrem ξ 51). This law
exists in a mutilated state on a bronze tablet, and was edited
by Klenze under the name of fragmenta legis Serviliae; it is
now however generally agreed that it is the lex Acilia (NVords-
worth pp 426, 427). By this law important alterations were
made. Senators were excluded from sitting on the jury, which
in accordance with the lex Sempronia of BC 123, was to be
composed of men of equestrian census. The sacramentum was
abolished and a special praetor was appointed for the court
(praetor repetunda). Four hundred and fifty iudices were
appointed annually by the praetor, of whom 100 sat in each
trial, the parties to the suit each choosing 100 and challenging 50
of those chosen hythe other side. If two-thirds of the court
returned a verdict of N L (non liquet) one fresh trial (ampliatio
11 in Verrem 1 §26) was allowed, but no more: any juryman
