comparantur, si soceri Scauri constantiam, ut ne quis te de
vera et certa possit sententia demovere, intelleget populus
Romanus integerrimo atque honestissimo praetore delecto-
que consilio nocenti reo magnitudinem pecuniae plus ha-
buisse momenti ad suspitionem criminis quarn ad rationem
salutis. 3 cm„ ”cca-⁴· Λ

53 XVIII. 53. mihi certum est non committere, ut in
hac causa praetor nobis consiliumque mutetur. non patiar
rem in id tempus adduci, ut [Siculi], quos adhuc servi
designatorum consulum non moverunt, cum eos novo
exemplo universos arcesserent, eos turn lictores consulum
vocent: ut homines miseri, antea socii atque amici populi
Romani, nunc servi ac supplices, non modo ius suum

de fin 11 ἓ 15.

delectoque consilio] ‘a choice,
select bench’ well si'sted by Cice-
ro's scrupulous care in rejecting
suspicions characters. Cf above
’ἐξ 16, 17, 49. Cf also pro Rosc
Amer ἓ ὅ qui...ex senatu in lzoc
consil inm delecti estis propter severi-
tatem.

nocenti ...... salutis] ‘that a guilty
prisoner has found the greatness
of his wealth more effectual in
arousing suspicion of crime than in
procuring him a means of escape’.

xviii. 53. committere, ut] cf
above on 3· 28.

adduci] generally used of bring-
ing into a place (in iudicium e-tc)
or into a certain condition (in
angustias, in oblivionem ξ 54),
hence Gronovius conjectured duci
(‘should be protracted') but need-
lessly, as the latter meaning affords
sufficient justification for the use
of adduci here: tr ‘should be
brought to such a pass' (by de-
lay). Π

[Siculi] if this word be retained
the construction is anacoluthic,

Madvig (opuscula) would eject it
as an evident gloss foisted into the
text to explain who were the
people qnos selw'...720n moverunt.
IIe remarks that even if it did
exist in the first draft of the speech,
it could hardly have escaped
Cicero’s notice when he revised
the speech sor publication. On
the strength of these considerations
1 have bracketed it.

servi. . . arcesserent. . . lictores. . .
vacent] note the emphatic antithe-
sis: the consuls designate had no
lictores but only seivi, they had no
right of compelling attendance as
the consuls had (vocatio ius vocandi
Gellius XIII 12⁷.) but could only
request it (arcesserent). For the
matter referred to see above ἐξ
25, 27.

now exemplo] ‘aster a new
sashion’ as Juvenal XIII 1 exemplo
quodcunque malo committitur or
rather perhaps ‘Setting a new
precedent'.

homines misere] cf above ἓ 28
testes praesertim Siculos timidos
homines et afflictos. . deterrere.
