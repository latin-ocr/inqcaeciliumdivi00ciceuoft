is, si mei consilii causam rationemque cognoverit, una et id

cum quaestor

in Sicilia fuissem, iudices, itaque ex ea provincia deces-
sissem, ut Siculis omnibus iucundam diuturnamque memo-
riam quaesturae nominisque mei relinquerem, factum est uti
cum summum in veteribus patronis multis, tum non niillum
etiam in me praesidium suis fortunis constitutum esse arbi-

trarentur.

qui nunc populati atque vexati cuncti ad me

publice saepe venerunt, ut suarum fortunarum omnium
causam defensionemque susciperem: me saepe esse polli-

una...et...et] principalis divisio
huius causae bipartita est, utrum
recte Cicero accuset et utrum Cae-
cilio sit anteponendus. Schol.

2. quaestor] in 7 5 Β C.

decessissem] in the proper sense
of quitting a province and coming
to Rome. So ξ 29.

omuibus] the Scholiast rightly
remarks that this is an exagge-
ration, as Cicero was Quaestor at
Lilybaeum and could only have
gained favour with the people of
the western half of the island.
The origin of the double Quaes-
torship in Sicily (see ΙΙ 111 Verrem
11§ 11, pro Plancio ἓ 65) is pro-
bably to be seen in the fact that it
was not acquired by the Romans
all at once, but (a) the western
part was ceded by the Carthagi-
nians in 241 BC, (b) the eastern
was not conquered until 210 BC.
When the whole island came to
be formed into a province the
Romans were probably induccd
by its importance as a source of
their corn-supplies to found another
Quaestorship sor the district of Sy-
racuse, without suppressing the one
already established at Lilybaeum.

cnm ...... tum] in aiming at mo-
desty of expression Cicero has
broken the construction with a
forced antithesis. The words from

cnm to eliam are thrust in, and
it is not at once clear that in me...
arbitrarentur is all that directly
depends upon factum est nli.

veteribus] such as the Marcelli.
M Claudius Marcellus took Syra-
cuse in 212 BC and thus deeided
the second Punic XVar in Sicily.
His moderation in the hour of vic-
tory endeared him to the Sicilians3
and he and his family became the
palrom' of the province. in me
ie patrono recenti.

populati] Tischer remarks that
though Cicero uses the deponent
not the active form os this verb,
he treats the past participle as a
passive, and always (it seems)
joius it with vexatus. Compare
ς’ 7, ΙΙ 111 Verrem 111 ξ 122.

cuncti] envoys from all the
states. The statement is too strong.
See ς’ ¹4·

publice] as duly·appointed clele-
gates. Compare Plautus Stich
490—1 al ei oralores populi suut,
summi viri: Ambracia veniunt huc
hyali puplice. The Greek would
be δημοσίᾳ or κοινῇ. See 11 in
Verrem lv ἓ 137 a Syracusanis
prorsus nihil adiumenti mque
publice neque privatim expectabam,
pro Plancio ἓ 22, and note on§ 12
qmzeslsse.

pollicitum] in the speech deli-
