xvi ABSTRACT OF THE DIVINATJO

would not justify you in forcing yourself on the Sicilians. They
want an advocate not only willing but able to plead their cause.
Avenge yourself on Verres if you will: but let them be preferred
to you for the present. As for the wrong done you by Verres, it
was after all no more than an annoyance; nay more, it was a
credit to Verres to have thwarted you in your iniquity for once.
And besides you have made it up long ago; to bring it up again
now shews that you either seek to play false with him or with
the Sicilians. Perhaps you will urge that you served under him
as Quaestor. A very good reason for forbearance, not at all for
attacking him.

(5) In truth as his late Quaestor you ought to be rejected at
once. All precedent shews this to have been for generations
a good reason for rejecting a prosecutor. The relation between
Praetor and Quaestor is one of almost paternal closeness.
Moreover the defence of the provincials on public grounds is
far more honourable than the doing it to satisfy a private
grudge. Such was the opinion of our fathers, as Roman history
shews. It is the undertaking of such cases by able rnen on
high grounds that is now causing such alarm among those
interested in maintaining the corruption of the law-courts.
But I maintain that the honest conductos prosecutions is one
of the greatest needs of the state at the present time.

How is this to be secured in the present case? 1 have a
reputation to keep up and hopes of distinction in the future:
Caecilius has neither. I can give security for my good saith,
which he cannot. Choose then the better man: and Ι may end
by warning you, gentlemen, of the grave suspicions attaching
to your order, to which you will lend eolour if you choose

Caecilius.
