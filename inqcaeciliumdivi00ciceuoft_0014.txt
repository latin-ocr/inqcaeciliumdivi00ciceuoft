x INTRODUCTJON

death of the quaestor Malleolus, 116 became pro-quaestor. After
being the chief agent of Dolabella in his misdeeds and extor-
tions, 116 turned against his patron when accused by Scaurus,
and contributed materially to his condemnation. In 74 he
became praetor urbanus by means of profuse bribeiy, as Cicero
hints. His maladministration in that office is described in the
first book of the second Actio. On the expiration of his year of
office, the province of Sicily fell to him by lot. His career there
is fully detailed in the last four books of the second Actio, and
it 15 unnecessary to enter fully into it here. His tenure of office
lasted three years (73—71>, as his destined successor, Q Arrius,
was detained in Italy by the servile war (ΙΙ 111 Verr 1V ξ 42,
Livy Epit 96). On his return to Rome he at once began to
take measures to defeat the prosecution, with which he was
threatened on the charge of ressc'lzmdae. His great object was
to get the trial put off till the next year, when two of 1115 chief
supporters, Hortensius and Quintus Metellus, would be consuls.
The profits of one of his years of office secured him their
support, as well as that of Marcus Metellus, who would preside
next year as praetor in the court before which he was to be
brought, of Lucius Metellus his successor in Sicily, and others
of the extreme oligarchic party. To secure himself still further
he went on to interrupt the course of proceedings by putting
sorward a tool of his, one Q Caecilius, to contest with Cicero
the right of prosecution. This was done in the divinatio, the
nature of which is explained in Appendix A. To this inter-
ruption we owe the speech known as divinatio in Caecilium,
which is not only interesting from its being the only one of
the kind that has come down to us, but is most likely a first-rate
specimen of Roman forensic oratory of this description. It is
clear and convincing, and breathes a lofty scorn for the speaker's
worthless opponent joined to a well grounded assurance os
success, Q Caecilius Niger, as the scholiast calls him, was
according to the same authority a Sicilian by birth. He must
have 136611 a Roman citizen, or he could not have claimed the
right to prosecute (see on div in Caec ἕξ 11, 19), and he was
according to Plutarch Cic 7 a frecdman's son (ἀπελευθερικὸς
avepmrroszlibertinus). lt has been conjectured with great pro-
bability that his father had been enfranchised by a Q Caecilius
