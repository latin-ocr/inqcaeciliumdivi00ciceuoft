impetrare: reus ut absolvatur non peto, sed ut potius ab

hoc quam ab 1110 accusetur, id peto.

da mihi hoc, concede

quod facile est, quod honestum, quod non invidiosum: quod
cum dederis, sine ullo tuo periculo, sine infamia illud de-

24 deris, ut is absolvatur, cuius ego causa laboro '. et ait idern,

ut aliquis metus adiunctus sit ad gratiam, certos esse in con-
silio, quibus ostendi tabellas velit: id esse perfacile; non
enim singulos ferre sententias, sed universos constituere:
ceratam uni cuique tabellam dari cera legitima, non illa in-

non peto] that is, not directly
but indirectly. Halm.

id] catching up the object. See Ι

011 ἓ 8 id nuuc poscilzcl‘.

da] note the singular, though
he says above ab indicibus. The
sting of the passage seems to me
to be sharpened by making Hor-
tensius address himself to the ju-
rors in detail with a meaning look.
The use of the imperative age 311-
dressed to more than one person
(Madvig ἓ 132 b) cannot be com-
pared with this.

dederis. . . . . Aedem] sinmstaneous,
since the one is irnplied by and
contemporaneous with the other.
Richter.

sine allo periculo] a divinalia
was not a regular trial, 31111 the
jury were not sworn. Hence they
would not run the risk of being
prosecuted for a corrupt vote.

infirmia] so ἓ 9.

24. melus] some sear, to back
up his inssuence. This is the most
general term for sear in the Latin
tongue, as will be seen on reser-
ring to Tusc disp lv ξς· 8—19
where Cicero uses it throughout
to render φόβος. It is then bet-
ter not to translate it ‘intimida-
tion'.

cerias] not quosdam, as they are
well known 10 him. So we say
‘persons who shall be namelcss'.
See 011 1 111 Verrem ἓ 22.

tabcllas] since BC 137 the votes
ofjuries in criminal cases had been
given by ballot. Each juror re-
ceived a small tablet coated with
wax. Upon this he wrote either
Azabsolw‚ C=c0ndemno or NL
:mm liquet. He then bared his
arm (hiding however the mark on
the tablet with his fingers) and
openly deposited it in the ballot-
urn. This he did in the turn as-
signed him by lot. In a divinalio
it seems, as sar as we can inser
from this passage, that the votes
were all given together. This would
make it an easy matter for the
confidential agents of Hortensius
to keep an eye upon bribed jurors.
This precaution was necessary to
prevent the latter from taking a
bribe on one side 31111 then voting
011 the other. See Ι 111 Verrem
ἓ 39, 11 111 Verrem 11 ξ, 79, and
Appendix C.
