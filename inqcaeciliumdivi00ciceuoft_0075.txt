A PPENDIX C. 5 5

10‚000 sesterces. The penalty was to be double (dupli) the sum

found to have been extorted or corruptly received. For the
text of the lex Acilia and comments thereon see &Nordsworth

pp Ι76-189, 424-438·

3. The lex Servilia proposed by C Servilius Glaucia, tribune
of the plebs, was passed probably about BC 111. It abolished
the ampliatio allowed by the lex Acilia, but provided that there
should be an adjournment of a day (comperendinatio) 11 in
Verrem 1 ξ 26 verum ut opinor Glaucia primus tulit ut com-
perendinaretur reum antea <i e under the lex Acilia) vel iudicari
primo poterat vel ‘amplius’ pronunliari. The trial was thus
divided into two parts, the actio prima and the actio secunda,
and the verdict was to be either of acquittal or of condemnation,
a return of non liquet not being allowed.

4. The lex Cornelia of Sulla (BC 81), under which the pro-
ceedings in the case of Verres were taken, seems to have been
based upon the lex Servilia. The alterations were the transfer
of the court (as of all the other courts) to the senators and
perhaps the increase of the penalty to two and a half times the
amount in question (compare div in Caecilium ξ 19 with Ι in
Verrem ξ 56) with the addition of outlawry (aquae et ignis
interdictio 11 in Verrem ΙΙ ξ 76). Provision was also made for
the recovery of plunder from parties other than the accused
into whose hands it had come (quo ea pecunia pervenisset ad
sam V111 8 ξ 2). The jury for each case were chosen by lot
(sortitione Ι in Verrem ξ 16) and the accused, if not a senator,
could not challenge more than three iudices (ΙΙ in Verrem 11
ξ 77). Secret voting seems to have been continued in the court
of repetundae (div in Caecilium ξ 24) although in some of the
crimina] courts under the leges Corneliae the votes of the jury
were given either openly or secretly at the option of the de-
fendant (pro Cluent ἓξ 55, 75).

5. The lex Aurelia tBC 70) altered the constitution of the
court of repetundae in common with all the rest, enacting that
they should be composed one-third of senators, one-third of
equites, and one-third of tribuni aerarii.

6. The lex Julia of C Julius Caesar (BC 59) abolished the
punishment of outlawry and increased the pecuniary penalty to
fourfold (quadrupli), cf pro Sest ξ 13 5, pro Rabirio ἐξ 8, 9.
