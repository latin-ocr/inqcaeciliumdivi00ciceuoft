A. Divinatio.

WVhen a citizen wished to impeach another before one of the
crimina] quaestiones perpetuae, the first step he took was to
apply to the Praetor or iudex quaestionis who was president of
the court before which the case would be tried for leave to
bring the charge. This was called postulatio (see on ξ 10 of the
speech), and was ordinarily followed by the formal notice of the
name of the accused and the charges to be brought against him
gnominis or crzminis delatio). But, since it was in the power of
any citizen to prefer such an accusation, cases might and did occur
of two or more wanting to prosecute the same man on the same
charge. It was then necessary to decide who should have the
preference (ceci potissimum delatio daretur ξ 10), and accord-
ingly a jury, unsworn, were chosen to pass judgment in the
matter (argument of Scholiast to speech). The proceeding was
called actio de constituendo accusatore 01· technically divinatio.
The meaning of the word needs illustration. Gellius ΙΙ 4 says
Gavius Bassus in lertio librorum quos de origine vocabulorum
composuit ‘ divinalio' inquit ⁶ indicium appellatur quoniam
divinet quodammodo iudex oportet qnam sententiam sese serre
par sit! nimis quidem est in verbis Gavi Bassi ratio inperfecta
vel veagis inops et ieiuna. sed videtur tamen szjgmficare velle
idcirco dici ⁴ divinalz'onem,’ qnod in aliis quidem causis iudex ea
[quae] didicit quaeque argumentis vel testibus demonstrata sunl
sequi solet, iu lcac autem re, cum eligendus accusator est, parva
admodum et exilia smzt quibus moveri iudex possit, et propterea
quinam magzs aa' accusandum idoneus sit quasi divinandam
est. With this compare the passage of Cicero (pro Plancio §46)
referred to by Halm, hanc tu rationem quum fugeris quumque
eos iudices habere nolueris, quorum in lanius delicto quum
scz'ealia certissima lum dolor gravissimus esse debuerit, qaid
