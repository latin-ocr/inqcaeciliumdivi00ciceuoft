JNTRODUCTJON xi

Metellus, whose name he had accordingly taken: for the Metelli
were patroni of the Sicilians, and, as Richter remarks, closely
connected with Verres. There can be no reasonable doubt that
Caecilius, had he been appointed to prosecute, would have
proved false to the cause and played into the hands of the
defence (praevaricari). But this design was thwarted by the
appointment of Cicero.

He next contrived a new means of delay. He got some
senator (whose name does not appear) to institute a prosecution
against another for alleged misdeeds in Achaia. Cicero had
asked for 110 days to collect evidence in Sicily: this ‘man of
straw' demanded 108 for the same purpose in Achaia. But
as Cicero says, he never went further than Brundisium, and
as Cicero got through his work in 50 days and returned to
Rome with an overwhelming mass of evidence, the sharn prose-
cution was given up. Verres next attempted to prevent the
electiori of Cicero to the aedilcship, but he was returned at the
head of the poll. Even now Verres did not despair. The trial did
not begin till -the 5th of August, and great part of the remainder
os the year would be occupied by various ludi, during which the
court would not sit. By means of long speeches and delays on
various pretexts, Verrus and his leading counsel Hortensius
expected to be able to protract the trial till January, when the
matter would corne ‘without prejudice’ (integram) into the
hands of his friend Marcus Metellus and an almost entirely new
jury. His hopes of bribing the present jury had been dashed
by the result of the sortitio and reiectio iudicum (1 in Verr ἓ 16).
It was hopeless to attempt to corrupt them, and the presiding
praetor, M' Acilius Glabrio, was a man of integrity. All his
efforts therefore were directed to securing the protraction of the
trial to the new year. This, the “ratio” which Cicero frequently
mentions as adopted by the Verrine party, he defeated by
the stratagern (consilium) of dispensing with the customary
long opening speech, and, after a brief introduction of the
case and explanations of the reasons for adopting this course
(the first Actio), of proceeding at once to the productiori
of evidence and examination of witnesses‚ a course he shews
to be not without precedent. The stratagem was completely
successful (Quintilian (Vl 5 ἓ4) remarks “Cicero summo consilio
