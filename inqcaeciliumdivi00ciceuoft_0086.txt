66 ABSTRACT OF THE SPEECH.

So next year with a new praetor and almost entirely new jury
we shall be able to baffle our accuser’s threats and the popular
expectation'. ξ 31. To-day is the nones of August: in ten days
corne the votive games, then the Roman. Forty days will thus
be lost: after that they think that by long speeches and delays
they will prolong the trial to the garnes of Victory, on which the
plebeian garnes follow. After these there even will be few or no
dies sassi. So the prosecution will be tired out and the matter
will come undetermined to a friendly praetor, M Metellus,
ξ 32. whom Ι would rather have as a juryman than a praetor.
You see the only course open to me. Ι might make a long
speech and win fame by eloquence and elaborate exposition,
but by so doing I should give Verres a strong chance of escape.
ξ 33. Let me reserve that for another occasion: on this Ι will
confine myself to bringing forward the evidence. My whole
business will be with you, Hortensius. As you have deter-
mined to fight me with chicanery, Ι must find some stratagem
to baffle you. §34 Your plan is delay: mine to bring the
trial to a speedy conclusion. Now after Ι had undertaken this
case at the request of the Sicilians, Ι proposed to myself a
greater object than the condemnation of this wretch; §35 I
determined to attack your intolerable tyranny and expose the
intrigues of your creatures : a task worthy of my utmost efforts.
ξ 36. As it is the villainy of a few wretches that discredits
our whole order, Ι declare war to the knife against these. This
shall be the finest show of my aedileship. Ι solemnly warn all
who deal in bribery and corruption to hold their hands in this
trial. ξ 37. Hortensius will be consul, I merely aedile: yet Ι
will do a greater service to the people in my humble office than
he with all his power. Ι will deal with the iniquities that have
been perpetrated since the control of the courts passed to the
senate. ξ 38. The nation shall hear from me of the purity of
the equestrian courts; of the corruption of the senatorial courts:
of the condemnation of Calidius and Septimius, §39 of the
proven reception of bribes by Herennius, Popillius, and Atilius,
of the scandalous conduct of certain senators in the trial of
Oppianicus. 5⁶40. What can I say of the notorious tampering
with the tablets of the jurors? All these facts I will expose with
accuracy and with rigour What think you will be my feelings
